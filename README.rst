This fork is based on work done by mrdoob and rhyolight. I have restructured
it heavily to suit my purposes. :)

The application is available under the MIT license. See license.txt for further
information.

IMPORTANT! If you want to test the application, please give the tagged versions
a go! They are considered relatively stable.

Planned features:

- undo (branching?)
- playback
- better background (solid/background/texture)
- scanfill brush
- constraints (restrict stroke path during painting)

Currently it provides following extra functionality:

- improved UI (pods and panels, shortcut: keys 1-6 map to given pod/panel)
- mirroring (horizontal, vertical, radial)
- additional brush options (size, alpha, jitter, mode, shading)
- brush preview
- support for multiple pages
- better palette (bounds + slots interpolated between those)
